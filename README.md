# Patient-Treatment-Classification
Machine Learning Project

This is part of my machine learning project. Dataset is taken from kaggle.
This model will predict whether patient needs to be admit in hospital or not. I have use multiple classifier like KNN, Logistic Regression and Neural Network. Amoung all of them, Neural Networks gives the best accuracy.
I have displayed confusion matrix along with AUC curve.
As for front end, there is Web based application that will ask for certain number of inputs and then predict, whether patient needs special care or not.
